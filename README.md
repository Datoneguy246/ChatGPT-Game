## ChatGPT made a game
*I didn't write any of this code. Skynet did it all.*

Honestly I'm kinda freaking out that it came out so well. It's a simple, if not slightly buggy, shooter game made in LÖVE2D (I'm on a bit of a Lua kick lately). It's really cool.

## Want to play it?

Sure! If you have the LÖVE2D engine installed on your system you can download this project and run it on your system.

You can also play my build of it in your browser [here](https://datoneguy246.github.io/ChatGPT-Game)!
